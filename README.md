Heat Wave Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting heat waves using past weather data. By applying various machine learning techniques, we aim to pinpoint regions that could experience heat waves, enabling authorities to provide early warnings and take preventive actions to minimize risks.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Addressing missing data points and ensuring proper feature scaling to enhance model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploring data through visualizations to uncover relationships between key variables and better understand data patterns.

Model Performance Evaluation:
Comparing multiple regression models to find the most accurate one, using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the primary evaluation metric.

Temperature Prediction and Alert System:
Using the optimal model to forecast temperatures and generate heat wave alerts for locations where the predicted maximum temperature surpasses 40°C.
Datasets

Training Dataset:
Historical weather data utilized for model training.

Testing Dataset:
Data used to assess the accuracy of predictions and to trigger heat wave warnings when necessary.
Models Evaluated
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
XGBoost Regressor
CatBoost Regressor (Chosen as the top-performing model)
LightGBM Regressor

Outcome
After thorough evaluation, the CatBoost Regressor was identified as the most effective model for predicting the next day's maximum temperature and issuing heat wave alerts.
